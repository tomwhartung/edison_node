/*
Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM, is a technique for getting analog results with digital means.

A simple node.js application intended to read and write analog values to fade a LED from Digital pins on the Intel based development boards such as the Intel(R) Galileo and Edison with Arduino breakout board.

MRAA - Low Level Skeleton Library for Communication on GNU/Linux platforms
Library in C/C++ to interface with Galileo & other Intel platforms, in a structured and sane API with port nanmes/numbering that match boards & with bindings to javascript & python.

Steps for installing MRAA & UPM Library on Intel IoT Platform with IoTDevKit Linux* image
Using a ssh client: 
1. echo "src maa-upm http://iotdk.intel.com/repos/1.1/intelgalactic" > /etc/opkg/intel-iotdk.conf
2. opkg update
3. opkg upgrade
